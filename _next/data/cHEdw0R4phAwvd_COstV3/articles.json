Let earth receive her King”</em></p><p>The end of the year 2021 is coming. It’s time to gather with your families, get some beers, do barbeques with your relatives, and reconnect with people you love. But alas, your website does not know nor care what you are doing for the holidays. There’s a chance that at one of the happiest days in our lives, your website decides to slow down or even worse, malfunctions.</p><p>As a software engineer myself, I’d rather be safe than sorry. In my emergency kit, I would throw in a phone charger, extra socks, a toothbrush, and a laptop. You read that right, a laptop. Just in case something goes wrong, I could easily turn on my laptop and see what went wrong.</p><p>Of course, we wouldn’t know what went wrong until someone from our team, or worst, from the users, told us what happened. But it’s the holidays! Everyone is taking their day off. Some are drinking, some are playing with nieces and nephews, you get the point. So who’s gonna tell us the bad news in the midst of joy?</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2Fl0MYRacUxYYHmXOxi%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&display_name=Giphy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fl0MYRacUxYYHmXOxi%2Fgiphy.gif&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fl0MYRacUxYYHmXOxi%2Fgiphy.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"299\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/1603185c78c4ecf82656f5f7205c0ee9/href\">https://medium.com/media/1603185c78c4ecf82656f5f7205c0ee9/href</a></iframe><h3>Thankfully, Monika does not take a single day off</h3><p><a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika\">GitHub - hyperjumptech/monika: Monika is a command line application to monitor every part of your web app using a simple YAML configuration file.

The name Monika stands for “<strong>Moni</strong>toring Ber<strong>ka</strong>la”, which means “periodic monitoring” in the Indonesian language.</p><p>With Monika, you can add as many websites as you want to monitor. You can monitor several undesirable events such as service outages or slow services. In addition, you can configure Monika to send notifications of the incidents on your services through your favorite communication tools like <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/get-notified-by-e-mail-when-your-website-is-down-using-monika-a-guide-to-smtp-notification-channel-91dfcbed2bf8\">SMTP mail</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/get-monika-notifications-to-your-whatsapp-using-monika-whatsapp-notifier-78a83560c04c\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/integrate-monika-with-microsoft-teams-get-notifications-straight-to-your-channels-using-incoming-3292147d6758\">Microsoft Teams</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/integrate-monika-with-your-slack-channels-to-receive-monika-notifications-using-incoming-webhook-9ed13e5a910e\">Slack</a>, etc.</p><h4><strong>Creating the initial configuration</strong></h4><p>To run Monika, you need to create a configuration.

If you are using a separate server, you can secure copy your configuration to your server by running:</p><pre>scp monika.yml <user>@<your_server_ip>:<target_directory></pre><p>Then, install Monika via npm install -g @hyperjumptech/monika or if you don’t have NPM in your system, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/releases\">download the prebuilt binary from our release page</a> and secure copy the binaries. You can confirm your Monika installation in your server by running monika -v to print out the installed Monika version.</p><p>Now that you have installed Monika in your server and have your configuration prepared, time to run Monika by executing this command relative to your Monika configuration path in your server terminal:</p><pre>nohup monika -c monika.yml &</pre><p>This will run Monika in background mode. There are many ways to run Monika in the background, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/4-ways-to-run-monika-in-the-background-docker-nohup-screen-and-systemd-1577a3e7b995\">which you can read in our previous article</a>.

In this example, we will be using the https://reqres.in/api/unknown endpoint. This endpoint will return a response like this:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/380/1*S0jKm1pIID_OOQLflycPyA.png\" /><figcaption>Example https://reqres.in response for the /api/unknown endpoint</figcaption></figure><p>First, let’s create an example configuration for Monika. Open your text editor and save the lines of code below as monika.yml :</p><pre>notifications:<br>  - id: desktop<br>    type: desktop<br>probes:<br>  - id: sample_1<br>    name: Sample Request<br>    requests:<br>      - method: GET<br>        url: <a href=\"https://reqres.in/api/unknown\">https://reqres.in/api/unknown</a><br>    alerts:<br>      - query: response.time > 1000<br>        message: Response time is {{ response.time }} ms, expecting less than 1000ms<br>      - query: response.status != 200<br>        message: Status code is not 200. I think their service is down.<br>    incidentThreshold: 2<br>    recoveryThreshold: 2</pre><p>Using this configuration, Monika will hit <a href=\"https://reqres.in/api/unknown\">https://reqres.in/api/unknown</a> endpoint. You will be alerted if the response time is longer than 1000 milliseconds and/or if the status code is not 200. As you can see here, the configuration above uses ‘greater than’ operator and ‘not equal to’ operator. There are many operators available, which you can see below:</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*1otfkCI-BIv1m2Dp2Kkbcw.png\" /><figcaption>All operators available</figcaption></figure><p>So, if we want to be alerted when if the first entry’s name is not cerulean, we could simply set the alert query like so:</p><pre>- query: response.body.data.[0].name != \"cerulean\"<br>  message: The first data entry should be Cerulean!</pre><h4>Guide to Helpers</h4><p>The main purpose of helpers is to help (<em>thank you Captain Obvious</em>). While we developed Monika two months ago, we stumbled upon a bug that <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/issues/428\">users cannot create an alert if the response body is empty</a>. To resolve that issue, we use <a href=\"https://lodash.com\">Lodash</a> to improve Monika alerting query capability.</p><p>The available helper functions that you can use are:</p><ul><li><strong>has(object, property)</strong>: Checks whether an object has searched a property.<br>For example, has(response.body, \"data\") checks if there is a \"data\" property inside the response body</li><li><strong>lowerCase(string)</strong>: Converts string to lower case. For example, lowerCase(response.body.message) converts message string value to lower case</li><li><strong>upperCase(string)</strong>: Converts string to upper case. For example, upperCase(response.body.message) converts message string value to upper case</li><li><strong>startsWith(string, target)</strong>: Checks if a string starts with the given target string. For example, startsWith(response.body.message, \"Hello\") checks if the message string value starts with \"Hello\"</li><li><strong>endsWith(string, target)</strong>: Checks if a string ends with the given target string. For example, startsWith(response.body.message, \"world!\") checks if the message string value ends with \"world!\"</li><li><strong>includes(collection, value)</strong>: Checks if a value is in a collection. If collection is a string, it’s checked for a substring of value. For example, includes(response.body.prizes, \"gold\") checks if \"gold\" exists in the “prizes” array.</li><li><strong>size(collection)</strong>: Gets the length of array or string values. For example, size(response.body.data.items) gets the count of items.</li><li><strong>isEmpty(value)</strong>: Checks if the value is an empty object, empty array, empty string, null, or undefined. For example: isEmpty(response.body.data) checks whether the data property is empty or not.</li></ul><p>Let’s use our previous configuration. As an example, we will be using the <strong>startsWith</strong> and <strong>isEmpty </strong>helper. We want to make sure that the third entry from the <a href=\"https://reqres.in\">https://reqres.in</a> endpoint response body starts with the word “true”:</p><pre>notifications:<br>  - id: desktop<br>    type: desktop<br>probes:<br>  - id: sample_1<br>    name: Sample Request<br>    requests:<br>      - method: GET<br>        url: <a href=\"https://reqres.in/api/unknown\">https://reqres.in/api/unknown</a><br>    alerts:<br>      - query: response.time > 1000<br>        message: Response time is {{ response.time }} ms, expecting less than 1000ms<br>      - query: response.status != 200<br>        message: Status code is not 200. I think their service is down.<br>      - query: startsWith(response.body.data.[3].name, \"true\")<br>        message: Third entry name should starts with \"true\"!<br>      - query: isEmpty(response.body.data)<br>        message: Data should not be empty!<br>    incidentThreshold: 2<br>    recoveryThreshold: 2</pre><p>In our updated configuration, we will now receive alerts if:</p><ul><li>The response time is greater than 1000 milliseconds</li><li>The response status code is not 200</li><li>The third entry name from the response body data object does not start with the word “true”</li><li>The response body data object is an empty object, null, or undefined.</li></ul><p>Save the configuration as monika.yml and run Monika using this configuration by running monika -c monika.yml in your terminal.</p><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/950/1*AvtIqUcGvoeDCDH3lZqD9A.png\" /><figcaption>Up and running!</figcaption></figure><p>Congratulations!

Get alert not only when your site is down but also when it's slow.</a></p><p>Just like the quotes said, “There’s a first time for everything”. If you haven’t heard or never used Monika before, let me give you a brief explanation. <strong>Monika</strong> is an open-source and free synthetic monitoring command-line application. The name Monika stands for “<strong>Moni</strong>toring Ber<strong>ka</strong>la”, which means “periodic monitoring” in the Indonesian language.</p><p>With Monika, you can add as many websites as you want to monitor. You can monitor several undesirable events such as service outages or slow services. In addition, you can configure Monika to send notifications of the incidents on your services through your favorite communication tools like SMTP mail, Telegram, <a href=\"https://whatsapp.hyperjump.tech/\"><strong>WhatsApp</strong></a> (It’s free!), etc.</p><p>Let’s get started. First, make sure you have installed Monika by running npm install -g @hyperjumptech/monika if you’re using NPM, but you can <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/releases\">download the prebuilt binary from our release page</a> if you prefer to.</p><p>Next, we need to prepare a simple configuration. You can create your own Monika configuration file using <a href=\"https://monika-config.hyperjump.tech\">Monika Config Generator</a>. As an example, let’s use an example of Monika configuration using Slack notifications from our previous article. If you haven’t read it, <a href=\"https://medium.com/hyperjump-tech/integrate-monika-with-your-slack-channels-to-receive-monika-notifications-using-incoming-webhook-9ed13e5a910e\">feel free to give it a read first</a>.</p><iframe src=\"\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/913692c828e79d382e8598f97441f888/href\">https://medium.com/media/913692c828e79d382e8598f97441f888/href</a></iframe><p>Save the configuration above as monika.yml and change the Slack webhook URL to your own webhook URL. Now you are ready to try each of the four methods available to run Monika in the background.</p><h3><strong>The Docker way</strong></h3><p>Most of you are probably familiar with Docker. Monika can be run using Docker in detached mode. All you need to do is <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\">install Docker in your machine</a> (if you haven’t) and pull the Docker image by running docker pull hyperjump/monika in the terminal.</p><p>After pulling the Monika image from Docker Hub, execute the following command to run Monika in Docker’s detached mode:</p><pre>docker run --name monika  \\<br>    -v ${PWD}/monika.yml:/config/monika.yml \\<br>    -d hyperjump/monika:latest \\<br>    monika -c /config/monika.yml</pre><p>As you can see the command above will find your Monika configuration in your pwd which is your current directory when running Docker. If you would like to change the path, change the ${PWD} to your Monika configuration path.</p><h3>The nohup way</h3><p>You can use nohup to run Monika in the background by running nohup monika -c monika.yml & in your terminal. If the command has been successfully executed, you may see an output similar to below:</p><pre>[1] 93457<br>2 appending output to nohup.out</pre><p>In the above example, 93457 is the process ID or PID. And the output of Monika is written to nohup.out file. This will run Monika in the background, and if you ever want to stop Monika, just kill the process by running kill -9 93457 in your terminal.</p><h3>The screen way</h3><p>No, I didn't mean your laptop screen or monitor. I’m talking about Screen as in terminal multiplexer. If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, install it by running sudo apt install screen. If you are on macOS you can install Screen via homebrew. After you install Screen, verify your installation by running screen --version to see the current Screen version. If it prints the version, then you are halfway through.</p><p>To run Monika in the background using Screen, run screen in your terminal. After that, you can run monika -c monika.yml inside the Screen. After Monika successfully runs, press Ctrl+a then D to detach the current Screen and put it in the background.</p><p>So how do I stop it? Run screen -ls to list all of the running screens. You may see an output similar to below:</p><pre>There is a screen on:<br>   9049.pts-0.the-server (03/23/21 08:34:38) (Detached)<br>   1 Socket in /run/screen/S-server.</pre><p>As you can see, the 9049.pts-0.the-server is the screen name. Run screen -r 9049.pts-0.the-server to enter the running screen. To stop Monika, hit CTRL+C and then CTRL+D to exit/terminate Screen</p><h3>The systemd service unit way</h3><p>To use the systemd service unit, you need to locate the Monika binary. For example, if you installed Monika using NPM, run which monika to know where is your Monika location. It should look similar to this:</p><pre>/home/hyperjump/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.6/bin/monika</pre><p>If you are using the binary version from the Monika Releases page and you put it in your Downloads folder, it should be like /home/hyperjump/Downloads or something similar.</p><p>Now that we know our Monika path, create a new file called monika.service using the output path from the which command:</p><pre>[Unit]<br>Description=Monika</pre><pre>[Service]<br>ExecStart=/bin/sh -c '/home/hyperjump/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.6/bin/monika -c <full_path_to_your_monika.yml>'<br>Restart=on-failure<br>User=<your_user><br>Group=<your_group><br>WorkingDirectory=/home/hyperjump/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.6/bin/</pre><pre>[Install]<br>WantedBy=multi-user.target</pre><p>Change the /home/hyperjump/.nvm/versions/node/v14.17.6/bin/monika according to your Monika path and also change the user and the group. As for the full path to your Monika configuration file, if you have your monika.yml in your home directory, the full path to your monika.yml is /home/hyperjump/monika.yml</p><p>After that, give the monika.service file the right permissions by running sudo chmod 644 monika.service in your terminal. And then, run sudo cp monika.service /etc/systemd/system/monika.service to copy the service unit to the systemd folder.</p><p>The next thing to do is run the Monika service:</p><pre>sudo systemctl daemon-reload </pre><pre># Run your Monika service<br>sudo systemctl restart monika.service</pre><pre># Confirm that the service is running<br>sudo systemctl status monika.service</pre><figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/959/1*O1A71FmQsN5PsaRjAahT7A.png\" /></figure><p>Using the systemd way, if your Monika service is getting killed by RAM management, it will respawn again because of the Restart=on-failure flag.</p><h3>Closing</h3><p>I’ve explained that there are four ways to run Monika in the background using Docker, nohup, screen, and systemd. By far the most popular way and the easiest way to run Monika in the background is by using Docker because of the familiarities with Docker. If you ask me personally, I prefer using the systemd way.</p><p>If you’re having a problem with using Monika, don’t hesitate to create an issue on <a href=\"https://github.com/hyperjumptech/monika/issues\">Monika’s Github Issue Page</a>.

So, without further ado:</p><iframe src=\"https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fgiphy.com%2Fembed%2FpGac4wa4HHDMVZhFIa%2Ftwitter%2Fiframe&display_name=Giphy&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FpGac4wa4HHDMVZhFIa%2Fgiphy.gif&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FpGac4wa4HHDMVZhFIa%2F200.gif&key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=giphy\" width=\"435\" height=\"175\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><a href=\"https://medium.com/media/d8d2d0da7f9b67e0ba1e766357b8a78b/href\">https://medium.com/media/d8d2d0da7f9b67e0ba1e766357b8a78b/href</a></iframe><h3>Setup Webhook with Slack</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.slack.com\">Slack is where the future works</a></p><p>First things first, you need to have a Slack workspace.

Or a notification from your boss saying that he couldn’t open the website because of some error called ERR_CERT_DATE_INVALID and says that your website is not secure? For me, it’s the weekend, no doubt. But for some people, it’s the expired TLS certificate that causes your website couldn’t be accessed.</p><p>Turns out that the automatic CRON job that’s supposed to renew your Let’s Encrypt certificates isn’t working. You made sure that you’ve read that Digital Ocean tutorial thoroughly. “I think I already did the right thing according to the tutorial, but why?” said yourself in confusion. But it’s not the right time to wonder why it happens, it’s time to renew the certificates. You run a single command to renew it, and <em>voila</em>. Everything is back to normal.</p><p>Sure, the story above rarely happens if your CRON job never fails. But systems are meant to be broken because it is created by humans, and to err is human.
